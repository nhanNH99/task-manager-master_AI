- Study how to name API endpoint based on `update_task_api.md`

---

## Your Task

- 1. Study the flow of the "Update Task" API in my project
- 2. I will provide you with the source code of the related Entity, Controller, Service, ServiceImp, and Repository files.
- 3. Please carefully read these files to understand:
  - The code structure and logic,
  - Coding style and conventions,
  - How the update flow is implemented.
  - Carefully analyze the provided code for best practices, design patterns, and naming conventions used in my project.
  - Take note of how each layer (Controller, Service, Repository, Entity) interacts within the update task API.
  - Prepare yourself to help me with future requirements—such as refactoring, adding features, or generating similar code—based on the learned style and architecture.
- 4. Additionally, study how the view layer is implemented using Thymeleaf:
  - Understand how `src/main/resources/templates` is structured and how `.html` views are rendered.
  - Observe how Thymeleaf integrates with the controller layer (via `Model` and view name return).
  - Review naming conventions and folder organization within the `templates` directory.
  - Take note of how static resources in `src/main/resources/static` (CSS, JS) are linked in the Thymeleaf views.
