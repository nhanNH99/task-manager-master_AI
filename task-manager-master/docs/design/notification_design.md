## 1. Notification Triggers and Flows

### 1.1. Triggers

| Scenario                            | Trigger Event                                 | Recipient(s)                         |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Task Updated                        | Task field(s) modified and saved              | All watchers, assignees, creator     |
| Task Assigned to Another Person      | Task assigned or reassigned to a user         | New assignee (and optionally, old)   |

### 1.2. Flow Description

#### 1.2.1. Task Updated

1. **User updates task.**
2. **System detects changes upon save.**
3. **System gathers notification recipients (watchers, current assignees, creator, excluding actor if preferred).**
4. **System checks each recipient's notification preferences and delivery methods.**
5. **System generates notification content with task details and update summary.**
6. **System queues notifications for delivery via selected channels.**

#### 1.2.2. Task Assignment

1. **User assigns or reassigns a task.**
2. **System identifies new assignee (and previous assignee if notification is required).**
3. **System checks each recipient's notification preferences and delivery methods.**
4. **System generates notification content (task title, assigned by whom, due date, etc.).**
5. **System queues notifications for delivery via selected channels.**

## 2. Delivery Methods

### 2.1. In-App Notifications

- **Display:** badge/counter, notification center.
- **Interaction:** Clicking directs user to the relevant task.

### 2.2. Email Notifications

- **Format:** HTML email with task summary, change details, link to task.
- **Batching:** Option to batch multiple notifications (user preference).

---

## 3. User Notification Preferences

### 3.1. Preference Management


- **Access:** Via profile/settings page.
- **Options:**
    - Delivery method toggles: In-app, Email, Push (on/off per type).
    - Frequency options: Immediate / Digest (for email).
    - Do-not-disturb scheduling.
    - Opt-out from specific event types (e.g., only task assignment, not updates).

### 3.2. Default Preferences

- All notification types enabled by default.
- Users prompted to customize on first login.

---

## 4. Validation Requirements

- **Recipient Validation:** Ensure user exists, is active, and has access to the task.
- **Preference Validation:** Respect userâ€™s latest saved preferences at time of event.
- **Email Validation:** Validated email address on file.

---

## 5. Error Handling Mechanisms

- **Delivery Failure:**
    - Log errors (e.g., email bounce, push failure) with recipient/user ID.
    - Retry mechanism (configurable number of attempts).
    - Escalate persistent failures to admin dashboard.

- **Preference/Configuration Errors:**
    - Fallback to in-app notification if preferred method is unavailable.
    - Notify user to update preferences if repeated failures occur.

- **System Errors:**
    - System logs all exceptions.
    - Notification service health monitoring and alerting.
    - Graceful degradation: Notifications are queued and retried if downstream services are unavailable.
